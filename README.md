# Processing Sketches
Learning Processing to re-enforce the basics.
Following along with [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

## Line Draw
Built after learning the basics of Processing then experimented with adjusting the size and color of a circle that follows the mouse. Click to reset.

## Ball Bounce
Using basic variables and if statements created a ball that would bounce back and forth between the left and right side of the screen. Then experimented by adding Y direction, random start location, random size, random speed, random X and Y direction, and finally changing the color of the circle after bouncing off the wall.

## While Circle
Exploring the while loop.
